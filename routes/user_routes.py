# This file is kept for legacy compatibility
# User routes have been moved to:
# - users_routes.py for backward compatible legacy endpoints
# - api/v1/endpoints/users.py for the new v1 API structure

# The v1 API endpoints handle admin/manager authentication (email+password)
# Legacy endpoints handle customer authentication (OTP-based)
